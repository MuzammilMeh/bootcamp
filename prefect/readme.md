flow" is a representation of a series of tasks or operations that need to be executed in a specific order.

A "task" represents a specific unit of work or an operation that needs to be performed as part of a workflow. It can be any callable object or function that encapsulates a specific action. Tasks can have inputs, outputs, and may depend on other tasks within the flow. 


tasks are the building blocks of a flow. They define the individual steps or actions that need to be performed, while the flow specifies the order and dependencies between these tasks.





Let's break down the properties specified in the decorator:

log_prints=True indicates that the task should log its prints, meaning any output or messages printed by the task will be recorded for debugging or monitoring purposes.

retries=3 specifies that the task can be retried up to 3 times if it fails or encounters an error. This allows for resilience in case of transient failures.

cache_key_fn=task_input_hash defines a function called task_input_hash that will be used to generate a cache key for the task. A cache key is a unique identifier for the input data of the task, and using a hash function ensures that the same input data will always produce the same cache key.

cache_expiration=timedelta(days=1) sets the cache expiration time for the task to 1 day. This means that if the task result is cached, it will be considered valid and used for subsequent runs within the next day without re-executing the task.
